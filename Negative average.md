#0D
The dynamics far from kinks/interfaces (close to the center of a domain) is well described by the [[0D dynamics]], as the field $u(x)$ is almost constant in space there.
We know that, in the 0D TDGL, the **sign of average value** of the oscillation $\bar{C}$ determines the kind of dynamics we will see. In particular, if $\bar{C}<0$, the field u will converge to zero exponentially fast.

This is what happens in 0D, so at the center of any domain in high dimensions. Meaning that, at any dimension, if $\bar{C}<0$ all domains will disappear exponentially fast. For this reason: **we are not interested in this scenario**.
