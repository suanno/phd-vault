#coarsening
If there are long-range interactions and this is the case when you have hydrodynamics(fluids) and esasticity (solids surfaces: stresses) then those mechanisms introduce an **effective** interactions have **no characteristic lenght**, so you cannot make them short range by looking from very far.

When long-range interactions are present, the system is different from the ones weâ€™re used to (spin system or solid surface with only surface diffusion and no elastic/strain effects that would introduce effective long range interactions. You have only nearest neighbour interaction, that is short range).

So, if long-range forces are present, then the CH and CA models are no more descriptive of the dynamics, because you get different coarsening exponents.
