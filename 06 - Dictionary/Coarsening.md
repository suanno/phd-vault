#coarsening
In a substance with 2 species, so the concentration of each can be described by a **single scalar** order parameter ($u=\pm 1$ correspond to pure (local) concentrations, domains may appear (the field u within a domain is quasi-constant +1 or -1).

**Coarsening**: the (average) domain size grows with time.
