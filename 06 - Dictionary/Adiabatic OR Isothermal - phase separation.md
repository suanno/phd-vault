This is the same nomenclature of **ideal gas**:

There are two characteristic times:

- thermal diffusion time (associated w/ prefactor of laplacian in heat eq.)
    
- molecule diffusion time (associated w/ prefactor of laplacian in diffusion/reaction-diffusion eq.)
    

across a distance of the order of the characteristic scale of the system (e.g. size of the domains).

- **isothermal** (phase sep): the thermal diffusion is much higher than the molecules one. As the movement of the molecules is what produces the _dynamics_, in this limit you can approx that, at any time _during the dynamics_, the temperature is the same everywhere (and is the one of the resevoir, so it is controlled).
    
- **adiabatic** (phase sep): the opposite limit, the molecules move faster than the thermal diffusion. If the difference is very big, then the resevoir cannot control the temperature of the system, which will be non-homogeneous, due to the heat emitted or absorbed locally by the two components reacting.
    

Fluids show typically an adiabatic behaviour, while Polymer mixtures an isothermal one.
