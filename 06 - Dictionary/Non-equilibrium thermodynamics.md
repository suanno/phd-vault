The initial and final states of a "reaction" are equilibrium states, in the sense that the thermodynamic equilibrium condition (macroscopic variables are constant in time up to fluctuations [due to the interaction with the enviroment]) is satisfied in the two states.
Although, to go from one state to the other, those macroscopic variables change in time during the reaction, so we say that, during the reaction, the system is out of equilibrium (and we call the intermediate states "non-equilibrium states").

Out of equilibrium, we cannot use the law of equilibrium thermodynamics (the ones that you find requiring mechanical, thermal and chemical equilibrium: e.g. the gas law). Althought, the law of thermodynamics still hold **if you manage to control temperature, pressure or volume of the reaction**. If, even with a thermal bath, the temperature in the system is not controlled or it is not homogeneous, then the hypotesis in the laws of thermodynamics are not fullfilled and you cannot use not even those law (**far-from equilibrium system**). In this scenario, people say commonly "you cannot even define a thermodynamic potential, e.g. a Free energy". This statement makes sense, because the model describing those far-from equilibrium physiscs cannot be written as ssystems that lower energy.
