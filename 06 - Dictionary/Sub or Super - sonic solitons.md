In a Soliton differential equation, if it is possible to identify a **characteristic velocity c0**, as in the Sine Gordon where you have a term $\theta_{tt}-c_0^2\theta_{xx}+…$ that is the wave equation plus …, then you say that a soliton solution (the specific one you are studying) that moves with a velocity **c** is

- Sub-sonic: $|c|>c_0$
    
- Super-sonic: $|c|<c_0$

Otherwise, if you cannot identify a characteristic velocity (as in the KdV equation), you can state that a soliton is super-sonic if c>0 and subsonic if c<0 (it classifies the direction of propagation).
