Many equations admits travelling-wave solutions that are localized ($u\rightarrow 0$ if $x\rightarrow \pm\infty$). However when two solitons interact, we can have the production of radation or not.

We state that an equation is a Soliton eq. if no radiation is produced after the interaction of two soliton solutions.

**N.B.**: To be considered a soliton equation, itâ€™s not sufficient to admit soliton solutions.
