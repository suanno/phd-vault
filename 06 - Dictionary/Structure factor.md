$S(q)$ is a quantity useful to check if the dynamics present self-similarity.

At different times, you measure $S(q)$ then you plot the curve rescaling the x-axis $q/<q>$ and the y-axis $<q>^3S(q)$ and if they mathch at different times, you have self-similarity dynamics.

The maximum of $S(q)$ is $<q>$.

Usually people see if the tails match (long $q$, as at short-wavelenght the self-similarity dynamics is not true sometimes due to other (small) caracheristic lenghts (as the interface between domains thickness).
