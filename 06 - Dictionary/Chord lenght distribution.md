It is a method to check if the dynamics shows self-similarity.

A **random point** in the space is chosen. Then a **random direction** is picked and the **distance** from the center to the first domain of the poor element **in that direction** is measured. Then another point and another dimension are considered. A **statistical distribution** of this measured lenght $l_{out}$ that is $P(l_{out}$.

To check self similarity, we plot the rescaled curve $\ell P(l_{out})$ v.s. $l_{out}/\ell$ where $\ell = 2\pi/<q>$ the average momentum weighted on the Fourier modes’ amplitudes.

It is an **alternative to the method**  of the structure factor $S(q)$. But it is preferred when $\ell$ becames (growing due to coarsening) comparable with the size of the simulation box and so the maximum of the structure factor, that occurs when $q=<q>$ is close to zero and so there are not many sample points (mi sono fidato non ho mica capito visto che di solito si guarda quanto matchi la coda, non ciò che sta prima del massimo!)
