In some differential equation, the

- stationary solutions or
- the travelling wave solutions
can be studied by making an analogy with the dynamics of a point object in a potential. There, the solution of the equation (for stationary states or travelling wave shape) correspond to the trajectories of the point object, where $u(x)\rightarrow x(t)$

An heteroclinic solution $u(x)$ of the stationary states equation is a solution associated to a trajectory $x(t)$ that, in the phase space, is between a periodic bounded trajectory and an unbounded one (see the link). So it takes an **infinite time** to reach the endpoint of the trajectory.
