In some differential equations where you see the emergence of Â kink/interface/front (**e.g. Cahn Allen equation** [think **1D** for easyness]) the stationary equation may be studied with a mechanical analogy and may admit an **heteroclinic solution**.

This solution of the stat eq describes the shape of an interface that moves: **Heteoclinic front**
