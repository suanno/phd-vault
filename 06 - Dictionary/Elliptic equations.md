As the [[Parabolic equations]] and [[Hyperbolic equations]] is labelled by considering the **highest-order derivatives** and making an analogy with the geometry of conic sections. 
General form:
$$\sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} + \text{lower-order terms} = f(x),$$
As there is no time derivative, it resembles a **stationary state equation** for a [[Parabolic equations]].
