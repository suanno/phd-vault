As the [[Parabolic equations]] and [[Elliptic equations]] is labelled by considering the **highest-order derivatives** and making an analogy with the geometry of conic sections. 
General form:
$$\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = \sum_{i,j=1}^n a_{ij} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x_i \partial x_j} + \text{lower-order terms},$$
There are both second-order space and time derivatives. So this class of equations describes **wave-like dynamics**.
