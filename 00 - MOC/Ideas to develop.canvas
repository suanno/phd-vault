We can still introduce an \"average velocity\" $\\dot{x_n}$ and state\n$$u(x,t)=u(x-\\dot{x_n}T,t-T)$$But, this time, this does not imply the differential relation, as $T$ is not small.\nBut maybe we can still do something with this less powerfull relation.","x":-561,"y":-368,"width":401,"height":648},

And this would be coherent both with our numerical results on CA [[Looking for a phase transition in TDGL]] and with the results of [[Onuki]] (theory, effective evolution of the structure factor) and [[Tanaka]] (experiments)","x":-120,"y":-368,"width":420,"height":648}
