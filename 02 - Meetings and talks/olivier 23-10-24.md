## Name of PC to run simulations
- _316: Has mathematica, but it is slow
- _241: It's slow but it has many cores 

## Method to calculate the (total sum of) lenght of the interfaces

Cauchy-Crofton theorem in diff. geometry book [[do Carmo, Manfredo. Differential geometry of curves and surfaces.pdf]] p. 46

## Onuki predicted timescale for stop of coarsening
Does he give an hint of timescale after which the coarsening stops?

## $\ell(t)$ growth if $\bar{C} = 0$ 1D and 2D

## No peaks in the structure factor $S(q)$
While in a conservative case (CH) there is a type II instability and the fast-growing wavelenght is finite, in a non-conservative case (TDGL) there is a type III instability, so the fast-growing mode is $q=0$.
That's why we see the peak at q=0 and no peaks at finite values.

## "Data Collapse" of the structure factor plot
If the value q on the x-axis is re-scaled by how fast the wavelenght of the system grows (q->q*t^1/2 in 2D), eventually we expect the curves associated to any t to match.

## Structure factor NOMENCLATURE
Look into fluid nomenclature, where systems are isotropic and so they are interested in the "radially averaged" structure factor. While in solids each direction is different!

Making a radial average, means dividing by the area of the thin circular ring.

## Measuring the width of the kinks
Compute the standard deviation of data around the kink position $x_k$.
