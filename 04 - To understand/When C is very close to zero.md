We're currently interested in oscillating $C(t)$ such that it takes negative values, but being positive on average. In this case we see an enhancing of the attraction of two neighboring kinks in 1D. And also in 2D we see that the time it takes for a circular domain to disappear is reduced by introducing oscillations.
Our **present hypotesis** is that this effects is due to the fact the **kinks broaden** when C gets negative values and so the bigger overlap of the kink's tails enhances the interaction. **Although** this happens also when $C(t)$ is strictly positive BUT it gets values very close to zero!
