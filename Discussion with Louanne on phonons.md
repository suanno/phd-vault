He is interested in epistempology, he is reading a book on that and he told he started with this with a class of epistemology at the philosophy departement in ENS. He cannot suggest any book to start, the class is important because you can make questions.

**My problem** with phonons is that you introduce them as quantum of the elastic energy of a crystal. In this context you do not give any properties to this quanta, in particular you do not say if they are localized and if they can propagate. You just say that the elastic energy cannot change of less than a quanta, that you call phonon.
In the classical limit (high energy = many phonons in the system) you can talk about acoustic wave packets built with plane waves, that propagate in the system. But when you have low energy, how should I visualize a phonon?
**His claim** is that this problem that I have with photon, I should have also for photon. And i suggested also for electrons.

Then I pointed that there is a huge difference between photon and phonons. When you show the EM energy in a cavity is quantized, you do not make approximations on the maxwell equations. Instead, in the case of the elastic energy, you make an approximation on the potential U(x1,x2,...,xN): armonic approximation.
But I should show him the proof next time, that I have in the notebook with the dirac eq.
