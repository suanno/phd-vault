# Intrinsic time scale $\tau_{C}$
The system has an intrinsic time-scale, represented by the **characteristic decay time** of the slowest Fourier mode.
In the linear regime, Fourier modes' amplitudes evolve as
$$u_{q}(t)=u_{q}(0)e^{\int_{0}^t dt' [C(t')-q^2]}$$
So all the modes decay if $C(t)<0$ and the linear approximation is valid (it doesn't matter if in the past C was positive, as you can  consider the time $t=0$ as a time where C was already negative). 
The slowest mode is $q=0$, with a characteristic decay time
$$\tau_{C}\sim C^{-1}$$
Now $C(t)$ is time dependent, so this timescale will evolve in time.
It **is not clear how to deal with the time dependence of $\tau_C$**, our **claim** is that, if $C(t)$ is oscillating around an average value $\bar{C}$, then we consider the intrinsic time scale of the system as
