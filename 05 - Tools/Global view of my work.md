I make a mindmap of my work.
I will use the **vanilla Obsidian canvas**
## Plan
- Look at any .md file written: 
	- Start from github /stage2/
	- Look in tdgl/notes/ for the one not there
	- Look at Obsidian notes /research/
	- Look at obsidian notes /meetings/ and see if there is something missing in the list. Write them down as 'to explore'
- In the flowchart md, start by writing the context
	- Name of the system: TDGL with oscillating C(t)
	- Goal: Controlling the typical size of the domains with C(t)
- Decide the 'cases' that you will see in the flowchart e.g. C><=0. Sketch before on paper.
- Draw the flowchart. Put only keywords and then a link to a MD
- Put all the MD that are not in obsidian, inside obsidian (and link to the mindmap)
- Review the notes.

### Extras
- Write the numerical and analytical methods in individual notes:
	- Multiple scale analysis
	- Numerical integration of TDGL
	- Save mechanism of simulations
	- Variables tracked in time
- Draw a workflow diagram: A time line of all the things I did from the beginning, in order of time
