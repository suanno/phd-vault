#twokinks #1D #negativeC 

In a plot of the distance v.s. the logarithm of (t-t_c), **it is not clear** whether there is a linear dependance of the two quantities when $t>>t_c$ ([[Annihilation of two kinks with NEGATIVE oscillations]]). In fact, there seems to be the "beginning" of a linear asymptotic tail (as it is slightly curved) but it is not possible to sample more the tail, as the annihilation (that is the duration of the simulation) grows so badly with the initial distance. In fact, **if** the tail is really linear, then
$$d(t)\sim \log(\tau_A-t)\implies \tau_A\sim e^{d_0}$$

Here I present some simulations for various value of $d_0$, that means the tail is more sampled as $d_0$ increases. The slope of the decay and the annhilation time are presented as a function of $d_0$.
