We can measure three different characteristic wavelengths in the system [[ell]] [[ell CC]] [[ell DW]]
$$\ell, \ell_{DW}, \ell_{CC}$$

To measure [[ell DW]], we need to estimate the **interface's thickness W**. Below, the thickness of the interface is estimated as the one of the stationary state associated with a constant C that is equal to the **instantaneous value of the oscillation** $C=C(t)$. It makes sense, because in the **adiabatic limit** the profile of an isolated kink is the tanh profile with $C=C(t)$.
$$W = \frac{2\sqrt{ 2 }}{3}C(t)^{3/2}$$
==Probably, for some missing multiplication factors in the code, $\ell_{DW}$ and $\ell_{CC}$ do not match. The shape seems correct, but shifted too down.==

Asymptotically, once domains are emerged, we expect that (see [[Relations between the wavelenghts]])
$$\log\ell = \frac12\log\ell_{DW}+ \mathcal{C}.$$
where $$\mathcal{C} = \log2\pi + \frac12\log (CD) - \frac12 \log I_1$$
and $$I_{1}=W=\frac{2\sqrt{ 2 }}{3}C(t)^{3/2}$$
Here $\mathcal{C}$ is called "const.":
