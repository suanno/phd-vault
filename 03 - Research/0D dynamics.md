#0D 
# Physical meaning of 0D
If you have a 1D or 2D system and you look very close to the **center of a domain**, there the field $u(x)$ is almost constant and so you can neglect its space dependance: 0D system.
# Analysis
In a 0D system, the field $u$ is a scalar, so there are no space derivatives
$$\partial_{t}u = C(t)u-u^3$$
and the equation **can be solved analytically** (see Chapter **4.1** of [[Master Report.pdf]]).
If C(t) is a **periodic oscillation** around an **average value $\bar{C}$**, then the results are summarized in this plot

(where we called $m$ the state variable $u$)
If $\bar{C}\neq 0$, then $u$ converges exponentially fast, otherwise if it is zero, the convergence is slower, as a power-law. This is known in the language of bifurcations as **critical slow down.**
