**In the past,** the formula of the Cauchy-Croft theorem was wrongly implemented. Over than taking the average of the estimates (dividing by 4, that is the number of sets) also inside the formula for each estimate there was a division by a factor 4. On of the two is eccessive. The current formula has been tested on paper for estimating the perimeter of a circle, and it works.
