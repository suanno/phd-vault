We can measure three different characteristic wavelengths in the system [[ell]] [[ell CC]] [[ell DW]]
$$\ell, \ell_{DW}, \ell_{CC}$$

To measure [[ell DW]], we need to estimate the **interface's thickness**. In the plot above, the thickness of the interface is estimated as the one of the stationary state associated with a constant C that is equal to the **average value of the oscillation** $C=\bar{C}$. It makes sense, because in the limit of slow oscillations, to leading (zeroth) order the profile of an isolated kink is the tanh profile with $C=\bar{C}$.

**NOTICE**: We expect that, asymptotically, when domains are formed and so the interpretations of $\ell_{DW}$ and $\ell_{CC}$ makes sense, they **are equal**. And this is what we see.
