#twokinks #1D #negativeC

Simulations show that it is possible to **accelerate the annihilation** of two neighboring kinks (a process that it's described, in the case when C is constant and positive, with an effective law in [[Effective dynamics of kinks]]) by introducing an oscillatory C(t) with
$$C(t) = \bar{C}+A\sin(2\pi t/T)$$
- Positive average ($\bar{C}>0$)
- Such that it takes negative values during the oscillation $A>\bar{C}$
You can see, from the simulations below, that the **annhilation time $\tau_A$ is reduced** if there are oscillations of that kind:
- In the first plot $C$ is constant and take different values for each curve (starting from left to right: 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1). If $\bar{C}=0.5$, two kinks at a distance $l_0=10.8$ take a time $\tau_A \simeq 2*10^3$ to annihilate.
- In the second plot C is time dependent. The amplitude of the oscillation $A=1$ is higher than the average value $\bar{C}=0.5$, such that C is sometimes negative. You can see that two kinks at a distance higher than the precedent case $l_0=20>10.8$ take a time $\tau_A\simeq 800$ to annihilate, that is lower than the times in the first plot.
Additionally, you can see that the experimental curve, for times close to $t_c$ (at the left of the plot) lies **below** the dashed black line, that represents a linear fit of the tail of the experimental data's distribution. This is a clear evidence that the process is accelerated by the oscillations.
