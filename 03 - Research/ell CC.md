This, togheter with [[ell DW]] and [[ell]] is a wave-lenght of the system that we can measure in simulations as a function of time.
This wave-lenght estimates the average domain lenght by dividing the area of the system ($L^2$) by the **total interface lenght $\mathcal{L}$.**

We estimate the (total) length of the interfaces $\mathcal{L}$ by using the Cauchy-Crofton theorem, using 4 families of parallel lines: horizontal, vertical, $\pi/4$, $3\pi/4$. Then we calculate the estimate for each family of lines and we compute the average $\mathcal{L}$
$$\ell_{CC}=\frac{L^2}{\mathcal{L}}$$
The Cauchy-Croft formula is, **for each family of line**:
$$\mathcal{L} \simeq \frac12*n*dx*\pi$$
([[do Carmo, Manfredo. Differential geometry of curves and surfaces.pdf]] P. 48)
- n is the number of times the interface crosses the parallel lines
- dx is the spacing between the lines
