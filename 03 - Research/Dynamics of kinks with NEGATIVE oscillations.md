We have an analytical formula for the kink's dynamics in the limit of strictly positive C(t) and slow oscillations [[Effective dynamics of kinks]]
$$\dot{d}(t)\simeq-24\sqrt{2} C^{\frac12}(t)e^{-2^{\frac12}C(t)^{\frac12}d}$$
## Comparison with experiments
Here we verify if, in the case where C(t) assumes sometimes negative values (but with a positive average: $0<\bar{C}<A$) the law is still valid, **assuming that the kinks do not move while C<0**:

Clearly, the distance changes significatively when C is negative, so our assumption does not hold at all! And so there is no match between the two curves.
## Slightly positive C
Notice that the orange curve changes significatively only when C gets very close to zero. This suggests to plot the function $\dot{d}$ as a function of C

You can see that there is a power-law **divergence of the kinks velocity** if $C \rightarrow 0^+$. This suggests that we could accelerate the kinks annhilation **with strictly positive oscillations**. But notice that, as $\tau_{C} \sim C^{-1}$, it will be necessary to consider a long period T in order to keep the _slow oscillations_ approximation valid.
## Comparison with experiments 2
Instead of considering the dynamics still when C<0 (that it's clearly false) we can consider C to get an effective value during the time when C<0. Properly tuning this value, we see

But considering a larger timespan, you see that there is no match anymore
