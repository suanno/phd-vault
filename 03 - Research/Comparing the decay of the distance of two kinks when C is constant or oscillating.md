## Varying the period T$
Here we fix:
- The initial distance $d_0 = 25$;
- The Amplitude A of $C(t)$: $A=1$.
We plot the annihilation time $t_c$ as a function of the average value of the oscillation $\bar{C}$ in a log-log scale. Remember from [[Effective dynamics of kinks]] that, if $C$ is constant and positive, then
$$t_c = \frac{1}{48C}\exp{(\sqrt{2C}d_0)}$$
So, 
$$\log (t_c C)\sim \sqrt2d_0\sqrt C$$

(the slope of the orange (T=30) is about 10 in the semilogy scale: about variation of factor x10 in y-axis each variation of 0.1 on x-axis).

#### Comments
- In the limit of small period (fast oscillations) the data seems to move towards the curve expected for constant $C=C0$. This is coherent with what we expect in the fast oscillations limit, where the shape of the kinks does not change significatively during a period and so the calculations in [[Effective dynamics of kinks]], where the kink is assumed to propagate without changing shape, can be applied.
- The annihilation time scales too quickly with the decrease of the period, so data for short periods T or large average values $C0$ cannot be collected.
- Data seems to lay on a line, but it could be just the beginning of a square root or other functions.

## Varying A
Here we fixed $d_0=25$ and the period of the oscillation $T=30$.
