This, togheter with [[ell DW]] and [[ell CC]] is a wave-lenght of the system that we can measure in simulations as a function of time.
We define it as the wave-lenght associated to the average momentum squared of the Fourier modes:
$$\braket{q^2}\equiv \frac{\int q^2 |u_q|^2dq}{\int |u_q|^2dq}$$
$$\ell \equiv \frac{2\pi}{\sqrt{\braket{q^2}}}$$
We know from [[03 - Research/Linear regime]] that, during the **linear regime** (but $t$ is not too small: see [[03 - Research/Linear regime]])
$$\ell\sim t^{\frac12}$$
Then, in appendix G of the [[Master Report.pdf]] we show that, asymptotically this wavelength is related to $\ell_{√êW}$ (which, due to coarsening $\ell_{DW}\sim t^{\frac12}$)  so **asymptotically**
$$\ell \sim t^\frac{1}4$$
