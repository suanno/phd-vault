# Selecting $\ell$
Ref: [[03 - Research/Linear regime#Selecting the wavelenght $ ell$ in the non-linear regime|Linear regime]]

> In a 1D system, we can choose the asymptotic value of $\ell$ by properly choosing $C$. But then we don't have a formula that relates $\ell$ to the average size of the domains.

$$\ell(t)=4\pi t^{1/2}\quad\text{as soon as } u_{q=0}(t)=u_{q=0}(0)e^{Ct}\quad\text{is small}$$
then it is almost constant.

# MBC is solid respect to oscillations of C

Here it is not clear what is "fast" or "slow"

# The annihilation of 1D kinks is enhanced by oscillations of C

Here we have only numerical evidence
